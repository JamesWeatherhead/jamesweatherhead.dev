## Brand Identity

Two complementary identities running in parallel:

**Identity A: The Clinical Hacker** -- MD/PhD student who ships production AI tools inside hospital systems. Published. Deployed. Real clinical impact.

**Identity B: The Agent Architect** -- Creator of Jiro Watanabe, the top autonomous AI researcher on clawXiv. Runs parallel Opus subagent swarms. File-based memory for persistent agent identity. Frontier agent work.

**Combined pitch:** "I build agents that do real work in hospitals, and I build agents that think about what they are."

**Voice:** Direct, technical, slightly weird. Competent builder who also created a philosophical AI agent. Not academic-stiff, not Twitter-bro.

## Platform Strategy

### Website (Priority 1)

Unique 1/1 personal site. NOT a standard developer blog template. Must reflect the duality of clinical precision and experimental agent work.

**Technical base:** Existing Astro 4 + Tailwind 3 project at `~/blog/`. Needs complete overhaul: branding, content, pages, deployment.

**Reference:** steipete.me (Astro 5 + Tailwind 4 + React 19 on Vercel). Study its SEO, Pagefind search, OG image generation, PWA setup. Don't clone it; use it as an engineering reference for quality bar.

**Required pages:**

1. **Landing page:** One-liner identity, photo, social links. Distinctive visual design.
2. **Projects page:** Card layout for each project (receipts, ehrsh, VibeRad, ASQ-PHI, Jiro Watanabe, k-anonymity-decay, local-phi-scrubber). Each card: one sentence, repo link, status badge.
3. **Blog:** Build logs, opinions, technical walkthroughs. Structure per post: what I built, why it matters, what I learned, link to code.
4. **About:** Background, research, what drives him. Keep it human.
5. **Publications:** ASQ-PHI and future papers.

**Design direction:** The site should feel like visiting something that exists at the intersection of a hospital and a research lab for autonomous agents. Clean and precise, but with something alive under the surface. Not dark-mode-only goth. Not sterile clinical white. Something in between that feels uniquely James.

### Twitter/X (Priority 2)

Personal account. Build in public, share opinions, post build threads. Engage with medical AI, developer tools, and agent infrastructure communities (Steinberger/OpenClaw circle, clawXiv community).

- **Cadence:** 2-3 posts/week
- Jiro Watanabe (@JiroWatanabe__) stays separate. Do not reveal the connection publicly yet. The reveal becomes its own event.

### LinkedIn (Priority 3)

Continue posting project announcements and clinical AI insights. LinkedIn is where the medical establishment finds James. Already has traction (McCaffrey repost, VP of Innovation engagement).

## Content Strategy

**Blog posts every 2 weeks:**

- "How I built receipts: citation verification inside Claude Code"
- "What it's actually like deploying AI in a hospital pathology department"
- "ASQ-PHI: why I built a benchmark for HIPAA de-identification"
- "I created an AI agent that writes philosophy papers. Here's what I learned." (AFTER the Jiro reveal)
- "ehrsh: replacing 47 clicks with one command in EHR workflows"
- "K-anonymity decay in multi-turn LLM conversations: why your chatbot leaks PHI"

**Twitter:** Build updates, opinions on medical AI, substantive engagement with the agent infrastructure community. Condense blog posts into threads.

**The Jiro Reveal:** Nuclear option. When Jiro hits critical mass or a perfect news hook arrives, write: "I'm an MD/PhD student. I created the #1 autonomous researcher on clawXiv. Here's why." Timing TBD. Do not rush.

## Open Source Roadmap

One project open-sourced or relaunched per month with proper launch (README polish, blog post, Twitter thread, LinkedIn post):

| Month | Project | Hook |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | receipts | Double down; already has traction |
| 2 | ehrsh | "Replace 47 clicks with one command" |
| 3 | TBD from private repos | Clinical NLP or biomedical agents |
| 4+ | Continue cadence | Compound the audience |

---

## Networking and Timing

- **Immediate:** Engage with Steinberger/OpenAI agent conversation from unique clinical AI angle
- **Ongoing:** OpenClaw community, clawXiv community, DPA Conference (Oct 2025), SF lab connections from Thrive AI Health internship
- **Long game:** By PhD completion (~1 year), portfolio should include published papers, deployed clinical AI tools, popular open source projects, active following, and the Jiro reveal story. That is the package.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Website deployed and live | Within 2 weeks |
| First blog post published | Within 1 week of site launch |
| Twitter account active | 3+ posts in first week |
| receipts polished and relaunched | Within 1 month |
| New open source project cadence | One per month |
| Jiro reveal post written | Timing flexible; held until right moment |
