# Markdown Guide for Writers

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes writing for the web easy and enjoyable.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings

```markdown
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
```

### Emphasis

You can use *italics* with asterisks or underscores, and **bold** with double asterisks.

***Bold and italic*** combines both!

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

**Ordered lists:**

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Links and Images

Create [links](https://example.com) with square brackets and parentheses.

Images use the same syntax with an exclamation mark:

```markdown
![Alt text](image.jpg)
```

## Advanced Features

### Code Blocks

Inline `code` uses backticks.

Multi-line code blocks use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Tables

| Feature | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Tables | Yes | Align with colons |
| Lists | Yes | Very flexible |
| Images | Yes | External or local |

### Blockquotes
